# Expense-Tracking-and-Budget-Analysis-System
The Expense Tracking and Budget Analysis System is a Python-based mini project that reads expense data from a CSV file and processes it using basic Python concepts such as lists, loops, and conditions. It calculates total and category-wise expenses and uses Matplotlib for simple data visualization.
